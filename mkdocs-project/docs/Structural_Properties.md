#Structural Properties
##Stress-Strain Curve

I apologize for misunderstanding your formatting preferences earlier. Here's the corrected version:

### Elastic Modulus
Elastic modulus, also known as Young's modulus, is a fundamental mechanical property that measures the stiffness of a material and its ability to resist deformation when subjected to an applied force or stress. It quantifies the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (resulting deformation) during elastic deformation.

#### Application
When designing structures or products, engineers and designers rely on elastic modulus to select appropriate materials. For instance, in construction, materials with high elastic moduli are chosen for parts that need to remain rigid and not bend easily, such as beams in buildings. On the other hand, materials with lower elastic moduli are used in applications where some flexibility is required, like the rubbery soles of shoes. By considering elastic modulus, designers ensure that materials used will withstand forces without deforming excessively and will function effectively in their intended roles.

###Yield Strength
It is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically under applied stress. In simpler terms, it's the amount of stress a material can withstand before it permanently changes shape or structure.

####How to use this property?
In most mechanical applications, you should design your part's operating stress to be below the yield strength. This will ensure that important features in your design will retain the same geometry during loading.
