##Stress-Strain Curve


### Elastic Modulus
Elastic modulus, also known as Young's modulus, is a fundamental mechanical property that measures the stiffness of a material and its ability to resist deformation when subjected to an applied force or stress. It quantifies the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (resulting deformation) during elastic deformation.

#### Application
In construction, materials with high elastic moduli are chosen for parts that need to remain rigid and not bend easily, such as beams in buildings. On the other hand, materials with lower elastic moduli are used in applications where some flexibility is required, like the rubbery soles of shoes. By considering elastic modulus, designers ensure that materials used will withstand forces without deforming excessively and will function effectively in their intended purpose

### Yield Strength
Yield strength is the point at which a material undergoes permanent deformation when subjected to external forces or stress, indicating the maximum stress the material can withstand before changing shape permanently. This property is measured in units of pressure, such as megapascals (MPa) or pounds per square inch (psi), and is a fundamental consideration in mechanical engineering.

####Application
Consider the design of automotive components, like suspension systems. Let's take the example of developing a new car suspension spring. If the chosen material for the spring has a yield strength that's too low, the spring might deform or sag over time due to the consistent load of the vehicle. Opting for a material with a higher yield strength ensures the spring can handle the weight of the car and the stresses of road conditions without undergoing excessive permanent deformation. This meticulous evaluation of yield strength empowers engineers to create components that retain their intended shapes and functionalities over the product's lifespan, contributing to safer and more reliable vehicles on the road.
