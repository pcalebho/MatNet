#Stress-Strain Curve
If you can only learn one thing from this, learn the stress-strain curve. It will give you a fundamental understanding of what a material experiences under load.

### Stress
What is stress? Stress is the measure of an external force acting over the cross sectional area of an object. As a result, stress is measured in units of pressure i.e. Pascals(Pa) for SI units and pounds per square inch (psi) for Imperial.  

$$\sigma (stress) = \frac{F}{A}$$

### Strain
Engineering strain is a measure of how much a material changes shape in the direction of the force it's subjected to. It's calculated by dividing the deformation caused by the force by the original length of the material. The result of this is a dimensionless number. 

$$\varepsilon (strain) = \frac{\delta}{L}$$



## Elastic Modulus
Elastic modulus, also known as Young's modulus, is a fundamental mechanical property that measures the stiffness of a material and its ability to resist deformation when subjected to an applied force or stress. It quantifies the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (resulting deformation) during elastic deformation.

#### Application
In construction, materials with high elastic moduli are chosen for parts that need to remain rigid and not bend easily, such as beams in buildings. On the other hand, materials with lower elastic moduli are used in applications where some flexibility is required, like the rubbery soles of shoes. By considering elastic modulus, designers ensure that materials used will withstand forces without deforming excessively and will function effectively in their intended purpose

### Yield Strength
Yield strength is the point at which a material undergoes permanent deformation when subjected to external forces or stress, indicating the maximum stress the material can withstand before changing shape permanently. This property is measured in units of pressure, such as megapascals (MPa) or pounds per square inch (psi), and is a fundamental consideration in mechanical engineering.

####Application
Consider the design of automotive components, like suspension systems. Let's take the example of developing a new car suspension spring. If the chosen material for the spring has a yield strength that's too low, the spring might deform or sag over time due to the consistent load of the vehicle. Opting for a material with a higher yield strength ensures the spring can handle the weight of the car and the stresses of road conditions without undergoing excessive permanent deformation. This meticulous evaluation of yield strength empowers engineers to create components that retain their intended shapes and functionalities over the product's lifespan, contributing to safer and more reliable vehicles on the road.


### Ultimate Strength
Ultimate strength refers to the maximum stress a material can withstand before it breaks or fractures under applied forces or loads. It represents the point at which the material reaches its highest level of stress before failure occurs. Ultimate strength is typically measured in units of pressure, such as megapascals (MPa) or pounds per square inch (psi). This property is a crucial factor in assessing a material's performance under extreme conditions.

#### Application
In engineering applications, consider the design of a suspension bridge's support cables. These cables need to endure heavy loads, such as the weight of the bridge itself and the traffic it carries. By choosing materials with high ultimate strength, engineers ensure that the cables can handle these substantial forces without snapping or breaking. Ultimate strength is also significant in aerospace engineering, where materials for spacecraft components must withstand the intense pressures and forces encountered during launch and space travel. By understanding a material's ultimate strength, engineers can make informed decisions to ensure the safety and reliability of structures and equipment in a wide range of industries.
